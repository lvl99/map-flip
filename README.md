# Map Flip

Flip a Map's keys and values around (for fun and profit!):

```
  import mapFlip from "map-flip";

  const exampleMap = new Map([
    [0, "First"],
    [1, "Second"],
    [2, "Third"]
  ]);

  const exampleFlipped = mapFlip(testMap);

  /*
    exampleFlipped: Map = [
      ["First", 0],
      ["Second", 1],
      ["Third", 2],
    ]
  */
```

If you remember an old server-side scripting language called PHP, they had a function called `array_flip` which
was pretty cool. This function does something similar but for maps.

## Install

Use `npm` or `yarn` â€” whichever your preference:
```sh
  npm i map-flip
  yarn add map-flip
```

Require or import into your file:
```javascript
  // ES5
  // no transpilation required
  var mapFlip = require("map-flip/es5")

  // ES6

  const mapFlip = require("map-flip")
```
